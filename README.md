# ATMEGA328P-TQFP32-PINOUT
Here'a a pinout diagram I created for the ATMEGA328P TQFP32 . It is shared under CC-BY-SA license. You're free to modify it and share. Just give a backlink to my project website if possible (I have not posted the pinout diagram on my website yet, because I'm planning to publish a getting started tutorial on ESP32). I'm also attaching a PDF version so that you can edit with any vector editing software. If you want me to create pinout diagrams for other boards, I'd be happy spend some free time on it. Let me know. Hope you'll find it useful :)
